### Galactic Guide ###
This guide will assist you in navigating the Commit-it-and-Forget-it repository. 

Quote of the day:
"Space is big. Really big. You just won’t believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is."

Explore every file, directory, comment, and commit. Sometimes, the most significant improvements are hidden in plain sight.

Good luck, and may your code be bug-free!
